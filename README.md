## 📌 Project Overview

This project was built during my ✨**AI/ML Internship at Brainovision Solutions Pvt. Ltd.**, as a mini-project assigned by **Pavan Sir**✨

The goal was to:
- Analyze a dataset of medicinal plants
- Visualize which plants treat which diseases
- Build a simple **recommender system** that takes disease name as input and suggests plant(s) with part used, preparation method, and reason 🌱💡

## 📊 Features

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis on Medicinal Plants  
✅ WordCloud of most common diseases treated  
✅ Bar plots on plant part usage, preparation methods, and diseases  
✅ User Input-based Recommendation System  
✅ Styled emoji-rich outputs in Jupyter  
✅ Simple, beginner-friendly Python project

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- 🐍 Python 3.9  
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook  
- 📦 Pandas, NumPy  
- 📊 Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- ☁️ WordCloud  
- 💬 IPython.display (for styled outputs)

## 💡 How It Works

```bash
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter
3. Run all cells
4. When prompted, input any disease (e.g., Diabetes, Cough)
5. The system recommends the plant, part used, how to prepare it, and why it's effective
